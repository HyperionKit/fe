## Video Recommendations:

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended for best compatibility)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher (will be scaled and cropped to fit)
- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **File Size**: Keep under 5MB per video for optimal performance
- **Background**: Videos should have transparent or black backgrounds to match the design
- **FPS**: 30fps or 60fps
- **Autoplay**: Videos will autoplay, loop, and be muted by default

## Optimization Tips:

1. Use video compression tools to reduce file size while maintaining quality
2. Consider using WebM format as a fallback (can be added to component)
3. Videos should loop seamlessly (last frame should match first frame)
4. Ensure videos are pre-rendered exports from your Spline scenes

## Example Video Export Settings (Spline):

- Format: MP4
- Quality: High (1080p recommended)
- Duration: 5-10 second loop
- Background: Transparent or Black
- Frame Rate: 30 or 60 FPS
